      <h3>Cerita Solidariti Pendidikan</h3>

      <div class="milestone">
        <h4>The Beginning</h4>
        <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, classrooms across Malaysia went dark. Students and teachers were suddenly pushed into online learning, revealing painful realities: unequal access to devices and internet, gaps in teaching quality, and rising struggles with mental health. In the middle of this crisis, Ida Shahira and a group of passionate youth who were in their secondary school and preparing for their SPM exams believed these stories could not remain hidden. They wanted to create a space where voices were heard, challenges were acknowledged, and change was possible. This spark gave birth to Solidariti Pendidikan — a student-led movement for a fairer education system.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="milestone">
        <h4>From Conversations to a Movement</h4>
        <p>What started as online discussions quickly evolved into action. Solidariti Pendidikan launched its first projects, including Cerita Pendidikan, a storytelling platform to highlight the real experiences of students and teachers, and <em>Dah Belajar ke Belum?</em>, an advocacy series addressing urgent issues in education. These initiatives brought awareness, sparked conversations, and inspired more young people to join the cause.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="milestone">
        <h4>Building Platforms for Change</h4>
        <p>The movement expanded with projects like TV Solidariti, where students and teachers could discuss education challenges openly, reaching broader audiences through digital platforms. Engagement grew, and Solidariti Pendidikan began formalizing its structure to sustain long-term advocacy, guided by three core pillars:</p><br>
        <ul>
          <strong>Access to Education</strong> – ensuring every child has the chance to learn.<br>
          <strong>Quality of Education</strong> – raising standards and accountability.<br>
          <strong>Mental Health & Well-being</strong> – valuing compassion and care within learning.<br>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="milestone">
        <h4>Formalization and Growth</h4>
        <p>With growing support, Solidariti Pendidikan was formalized as an organization under the Registrar of Societies (RoS). This step allowed it to widen its reach, strengthen its collaborations, and carry forward student-led advocacy into structured projects and campaigns.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="milestone">
        <h4>A Movement That Belongs to All</h4>
        <p>Today, Solidariti Pendidikan stands as a living proof that change begins with youth voices. From flood relief projects to policy dialogues, from digital advocacy to community programs, SP continues to push for a more just and inclusive education system in Malaysia. What began as a pandemic-born spark has grown into a movement — one that empowers students, supports teachers, and reimagines what education can and should be.</p>
        <p>And this story is far from over. It is still being written — by every student, teacher, and changemaker who dares to dream of a better future for Malaysian education.</p>
